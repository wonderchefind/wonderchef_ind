    <dt class="acc_trigger specic_tab"><a href="#toggle1">Which mixer grinder is good for home?</a></dt>
    <dd class="acc_container specic_tab">
        <div class="block">Wattage, rotational speed (RPM), and quality of blades are the
three important aspects you should focus on while choosing a
mixer. Higher wattage is useful for grinding tougher ingredients
and at a faster speed. The RPM of a mixer grinder will tell you
how fast its blades rotate. Blades in the mixer do all the work so
their quality matters.
Wonderchef Nutri-blend is a powerful 600 watt, 22000 RPM
motor that can grind the toughest ingredients with ease. Its
blades are made from surgical grade, corrosion-resistant
stainless steel which means they'll retain their sharpness for a
longer period of time.

    <dd class="acc_container">
        <div class="block">Mixer-grinders can run on true sine wave inverters. However, it
is not advisable to run high-wattage mixers-grinders on the
inverters as they'll drain the battery faster.
Wonderchef Nutri-blend, with its efficient 600-watt motor, can
be safely used even with regular inverters.

    <dd class="acc_container">
        <div class="block">You can prepare juices with a mixer grinder using the juice filter
attachment. Nutri-blend CKM comes with a big jar of 1.2 Ltr
capacity with a juice filter to help extract healthy juices from
almost all fruits and vegetables

   <dt class="acc_trigger specic_tab"><a href="#toggle4">What is the ideal wattage for a mixer grinder?</a></dt>
    <dd class="acc_container">
        <div class="block">Domestic mixer-grinders that come in various capacities from
250 Watts to 1000 Watts and you should choose it based on
usage. Higher wattage is ideal for grinding tougher ingredients
and at a faster speed. However, the performance also depends
on the size of the jars - the smaller the jars the better and faster
the output.
Nutri-blend with its industry-leading engineering and design
has an optimal combination of jar sizes and power and hence
it's superior to many high-powered mixer-grinders with its 400
Watt motor and much more energy-efficient too. What gives
Nutri-blend the edge is its speed of 22,000 RPM which creates
enough power to break down all types of ingredients. A normal
mixer, on the other hand, operates at only 10,000 RPM.

   <dt class="acc_trigger specic_tab"><a href="#toggle5">Why are mixer jars made of steel, making it impossible to see the ingredients inside?</a></dt>
    <dd class="acc_container">
        <div class="block">Mixers run at a high speed putting a lot of pressure on the jars.
Hence, most mixers have steel jars. Our consumer research
shows that people would like to see the status of the
ingredients inside while in operation. This is why Nutri-blend
was specially designed with transparent but unbreakable
polycarbonate jars that last you for years while enabling you to
see inside.

   <dt class="acc_trigger specic_tab"><a href="#toggle6">Are jars of Nutri-blend strong enough?</a></dt>
    <dd class="acc_container">
        <div class="block">Nutri-blend jars are made of unbreakable polycarbonate which
is food safe. They last for years without cracking or breaking.
Moreover, the special lid that comes with the product converts
them into a storage jar.

   <dt class="acc_trigger specic_tab"><a href="#toggle7">How does the mixer grinder work?</a></dt>
    <dd class="acc_container">
        <div class="block">When you start the mixer grinder, the motor begins to turn the
blades. This spinning of the blades sets the ingredients in a
circular motion which creates a vacuum at the center. This
displaces the contents towards the axis (and rotating blades)
while the whirling motion forces them up on the sides. This
turns the ingredients into a smooth, consistent paste.

    <dd class="acc_container">
        <div class="block">When the ingredients rotate at a fast speed, they're thrown up
due to centrifugal force. This is why, in normal mixers you need
to hold the lid in place to avoid the splatter. Wonderchef
Nutri-blend has been designed keeping your convenience in mind. Its unique inverted design screws the lid safely to the
base with zero chance of the food spilling out. This hands-free
design ensures that you do not need to keep your hand on the
lid or the base.
