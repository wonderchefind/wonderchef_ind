    <dt class="acc_trigger specic_tab"><a href="#toggle1">How does the pressure cooker work?</a></dt>
    <dd class="acc_container specic_tab">
        <div class="block">Inside the tightly sealed pressure cooker, the water is heated and eventually boils into steam. Since the steam cannot escape, it gets accumulated around the food, there by cooking the food. All those trapped water molecules increase the pressure inside the cooker and cooking the food hence the name pressure cooker.

    <dt class="acc_trigger specic_tab"><a href="#toggle2">What can I not put/cook in a pressure cooker?	</a></dt>
    <dd class="acc_container">
        <div class="block">Even when placed on a rack, breaded meats or vegetables are not recommended due to the fact that the breading will get soggy as the pressure cooker cooks with steam. The breading may also fall off the meat and cause burning on the bottom of the pressure cooker.

    <dt class="acc_trigger specic_tab"><a href="#toggle3">How to choose the capacity of the pressure cooker?</a></dt>
    <dd class="acc_container">
        <div class="block">A small family of 3-4 who use pressure cooker regularly, then a standard pressure cooker of 3-5 litres will be enough. Regalia pressure cooker from Wonderchef comes in these capacities and in attractive colours of purple and red. We also have Ultima pressure cooker in 3lt and 5 lt capacity with mirror finish body. A bigger/joint family of 5+ people will require a pressure cooker in the range of 5- 9 litres. The Taurus hard anodised pressure cooker from Wonderchef comes in 8lt capacity for large cooking needs. If you're cooking baby food or are staying alone, then 1-1.5 litres would be your ideal size.
