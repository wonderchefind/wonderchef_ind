<p><b>Meet the elegant yet toughest cookware, Wonderchef Die-Cast cookware.</b></p>      
<p>Proven by a rigorous test, the Wonderchef Die-Cast range is so sturdy that the cookware doesn't lose shape even if an SUV car goes over it. </p><p>That's right; we drove an SUV repeatedly over different pans. While the pressed pans lost their shape, Wonderchef Die-cast pans retained their original shape perfectly - thanks to the unique property of pure Aluminium. When molten metal is poured into a cast and solidified, it becomes as hard as concrete.</p>
